# First project for PHYSICS170N

Author:

* Eduardo Vazquez Kuri

## What is this about?

A very rudimentary/classic 1st-to-2nd order ODE solver. It uses:

* Runge kutta (2, 4)
* Euler
* Symplectic Euler
* St√∂rmer-Verlet

Methods to do stuff. 

## Why?

Need to get all my credits and might be useful to showcase my skillz.

## How good is it?

It supports vector fields ($f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^n$) but:

* It's buggy.
* It has barely any documentation. 
* It requires tweaking. It might not work or explode if asked a lot of it.

## Can I test it out?

Sure, hope you like it! Do make adjustments and let me know about them! Please do I beg of you all of this is kinda new to me thx.
